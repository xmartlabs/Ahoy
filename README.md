## Introduction

Ahoy is a swift library that helps you build awesome onboarding experiences for your users.

## Usage
In order to setup your onboarding you need to define 2 components:
* The specific view controller that you are going to use, which should subclass from `OnboardingViewController`. This will handle all the specific logic related to displaying the slides and managing any global control that you want to use (an skip button for example).
* A `Presenter` which should implement the protocol `OnboardingPresenter`. This will handle all the specific functionality of each cell (which text goes where, the type of cells, etc.)

#### Basic setup
* Create your own presenter implementation, either implementing `OnboardingPresenter` protocol or subclassing from `BasePresenter`.
* Create your `OnboardingViewController` subclass and set the `presenter` property to an instance of your presenter's class. This must be done **before** calling `super.viewDidLoad()`.

After this you are ready to go! You can add any other ui components that you want via IBOutlets or directly by code.
##### Example

```swift
import Ahoy
class MovieFanOnboardingController: OnboardingViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        presenter = MovieFanPresenter()
        presenter.onOnBoardingFinished = { [weak self] in
            _ = self?.navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true)
        }
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

}

class MovieFanPresenter: BasePresenter {
  // Your presenter implementation's here
}
```

#### Callbacks
In order to manage user interaction, when the onboarding is finished, skipped or when a slide is being displayed. Ahoy provides a few helpers to manage this consistently:
  * `onOnboardingSkipped`: Is called by the controller when the user taps on the skip action.
  * `onOnBoardingFinished`: Is called by the controller when the user taps on finish.
  * `visibilityChanged(for cell: UICollectionViewCell, at index: Int, amount: CGFloat)`: is called each time the visibility of a cell changes, this can be used to implement some cool animations between each cell.

#### BasePresenter
By default, Ahoy provides an implementation of `OnboardingPresenter`, `BasePresenter` which handles basic functionality and has some customization parameters:

```swift
public var cellBackgroundColor: UIColor
public var doneButtonColor: UIColor
public var doneButtonTextColor: UIColor
public var textColor: UIColor
public var swipeLabelText: String
public var titleFont: UIFont
public var bodyFont: UIFont
public var skipColor: UIColor
public var skipTitle: String
public var model: [OnboardingSlide]
public var onOnBoardingFinished: (() -> ())?
public var onOnboardingSkipped: (() -> ())?
```

#### BottomOnobardingController
Ahoy provides another implementation of the `OnboardingViewController` that has global controls at the bottom of the screen. The `BottomOnobardingController` uses `BottomPresenter` as a Presenter.
